# THAMP-MRI

The instructions for recruiting and running participants are located on the THAMP sub-page of the lab wiki. This repo contains instructions for preprocessing the mri data both manually and automated. It also has instructions for analysis up to 2nd level analysis using SPM. The code for automated dicom to bids conversion and for automated preprocessing in CONN are located in this repo.

Preprocessing and Analysis guide can be found in the THAMP Overview Document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EL8839oqc8otykgAeb8aCeg1eMtUUXese7bMQRwbxTM/edit?usp=drivesdk

Updated preprocessing guide, using fMRIprep to incorporate field maps, can be found here: https://github.com/mind-lab-bos/MBI_Project_MRI_Analysis/wiki/Fmriprep-preprocessing
